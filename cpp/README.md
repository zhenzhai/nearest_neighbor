# How to run our project

* All source files are located in 'src' folder.

* Before running the 'src/main.cpp', please take a look at each of the dataset folders. We have [MNIST], [CIFAR], [Word2Vec], [BIG5], and [Million Songs].

* You will first need to download the corresponding dataset and convert the raw data. Please see README in each of the dataset folders to find instructions.

* Then you can edit the 'src/main.cpp' file to include the dataset that you want to run. You can only run one dataset at a time.

* We explored 7 different data structures, they are k-d trees, randomized k-d trees, PCA trees, RP trees, virtual RP trees, spill trees, and RP select trees.

* Please edit the 'src/main.cpp' correspondingly and choose the data structures you want to run.
